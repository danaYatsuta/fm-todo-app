## My process

### Built with

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) (including [plugin for Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss))
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

### What I learned

- How to implement dark mode with Tailwind CSS
- How to manipulate element's position depending on screen size
- How to implement drag events
- How to use state management in Vue

### Useful resources

- [Vite documentation on deploying to GitHub Pages](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#github-pages) - much simpler way to deploy Vite projects on GitHub Pages instead of manually rebuilding and reuploading `dist` folder
- [MDN documentation on drag and drop events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API) - very helpful resource for understanding how to implement drag events
- [Stack Overflow question on dragleave activating when hovering over parent's children](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7110353/html5-dragleave-fired-when-hovering-a-child-element) - answers were helpful in identifying and fixing the issue in the title
